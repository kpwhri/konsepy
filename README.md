# konsepy

Framework for build NLP information extraction systems using regular expressions. `konsepy` then enables leveraging the NLP system to create a silver standard for fine-tuning a transformer model. 

## Installation

* `konsepy` is designed to be used with the [`knosepy_nlp_template`](https://github.com/kpwhri/konsepy_nlp_template)
  * See the README there for current installation instructions.
* To use `konsepy` as a standalone entity:
  * Install with `pip`:
    * `pip install konsepy[all]`
    * For sentence-splitting corpora from fine-tuning a sentence based transformer, `spacy` will also need to be installed and configured.

## Usage

For now, find documentation for this library (and a template to download) from https://github.com/kpwhri/konsepy_nlp_template.


## Roadmap

* Change labels to some metadata object to allow more diverse input sources and run info
